DITTANY: Dynamic Information and TainTing flow ANalYsis tool

I have developed this tool while conducting my PhD at the American University of Beirut. I have collected the results and written the paper while affiliated with the Lebanese University. I submitted the paper during my early days at Inria/University of Lille. The paper received the best paper award at the Binary Analysis Research Workshop 2022 (BAR'22)  that was co-located with Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2022 (NDSS'22), San Diego, California, USA.
